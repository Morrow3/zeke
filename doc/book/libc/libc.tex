\part{C Library Functions}

This part describes library function wrappers provided by the kernel syscall
interface.

Zeke implements the most of the userland services by providing a shared memory
region in virtual memory that contains libc wrappers to be used by user space
code. These functions can be called like any library function and they will
make the actual syscall.

The library interface can be further wrapped with another layer of
"abstraction", specifically a libc library, or libc implementation may just
make direct syscalls if desired so.
