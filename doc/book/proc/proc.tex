The process and thread management in Zeke is based on an idea
that a process is a container for threads owned by the process
and it manages the memory space used by its threads. Naturally
this means that a process must always have at least one thread
which is the main thread and all other threads are children of
that thread. Any process not having a main thread is immediately
removed from the system because there is nothing to execute.

Calling \verb+fork+ syscall causes a creation of a new process
container, cloning of the currently executing thread as a new
main thread as well as marking all current memory regions as
copy-on-write regions for both processes, to trivially get rid
of race conditions.

When a process calls \verb+exec+ syscall the current main thread
is replaced by a new clean main thread that's pointing to the
new process image, ie. \acs{PC} is set to the proper entry point of
the new image.

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+tid_X+ = Thread ID
  \item \verb+pid_a+ = Process ID
  \item \verb+0+ = NULL
\end{itemize}

\verb+process_a+ a has a main thread called \verb+main+. Thread
\verb+main+ has two child thread called \verb+child_1+ and \verb+child_2+.
\verb+child_2+ has created one child thread called \verb+child_2_1+.

\verb+main+ owns all the threads it has created and at the same time child
threads may own their own threads. If parent thread is killed then the
children of the parent are killed first in somewhat reverse order.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+parent+ = Parent thread of the current thread if any
  \item \verb+first_child+ = First child created by the current thread
  \item \verb+next_child+ = Next child in chain of children created by the
        parent thread
\end{itemize}

\section{Cases}
\subparagraph*{process\_a is killed}

Before \verb+process_a+ can be killed \verb+main+ thread must be killed,
because it has child threads its children has to be resolved and killed in
reverse order of creation.

\subparagraph*{child\_2 is killed}

Killing of \verb+child_2+ causes \verb+child_2_1+ to be killed first.


\chapter{Thread Scheduler}

The scheduler in Zeke is conceptually object oriented and all
scheduling entities, CPUs as well as scheduling policies are
implemented as objects in the scheduling system. Each CPU can
be technically populated with a different set of scheduling
policies that are then only executable on that particular
CPU, see figure \ref{figure:objscheds}.
