\section{About vnodes and inodes}

During this document terms \acs{vnode} and \acs{inode} are unfortunately mixed
with each other. Historically inode was the way to index files in Unix-style
file systems.\cite{Wikipedia:inode} While Zeke continues this fashion it adds
a concept of vnodes that are used as an abstraction level between actual file
systems and \acf{vfs}. This concept is not new by any means but reader has to
be familiar with the concept especially due to the mixed terminology in this
document.

To sum up, vnodes are used from user level to \acs{vfs} level and actual file
system implementations are using internally inodes and externally vnodes.

\section{Kernel Interface}

Kernel interface to ramfs is built around virtual function structs defined in
\acs{vfs} header file \verb+fs.h+ and some user space header files defining
unified data types.

A new file system is first registered to the kernel by passing a pointer to
fs struct that is an interface to mount a new superblock, ramfs in this case.
This struct is defined as in listing \ref{list:fs}.

When superblock is mounted a superblock struct pointer is returned. This pointer
servers as the main interface to the newly mounted file system. Superblock is
defined as in listing \ref{list:fs_sb}. By using superblock function calls it's
possible to get direct references to vnodes and \acs{vnode} operations e.g. for
modifying file contents or adding new hard links to a directory node.

\lstinputlisting[label=list:fs_sb,caption=superblock struct definition.]{fs/fs_superblock.c}

Currently supported vnode operations are listed in listing \ref{list:vnode_ops}.
Names of these operations are selected to somewhat match with the corresponding
function names defined in \acs{POSIX}. Albeit arguments of the \acs{vfs} level
functions are quite different from the user level.
