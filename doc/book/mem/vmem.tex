\section{Introduction to vmem in Zeke}

Every process has its own master page table and varying number of L2 page
tables. Kernel has its own master page table too. Static/fixed entries are
copied to all master page tables created. Process shares its master page
table with its childs.

Process page tables are stored in dynmem area.

ARM note: Only 4 kB pages are used with L2 page tables so XN (Execute-Never) bit
is always usable also for L2 pages.

See figure \ref{figure:vmsubsys}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+kmalloc+  - is a kernel level memory allocation service, used
                        solely for memory allocations in kernel space.
  \item \verb+vralloc+  - VRAlloc is a special memory allocator targetted to
                        allocate blocks of memory that will be mapped in virtual
                        address space of processes, it returns \verb+vm_region+
                        structs instead of just base address of the allocation.
  \item \verb+dynmem+   - is a dynamic memory allocation system that allocates
                        \& frees contiguous blocks of physical memory.
  \item \verb+ptmapper+ - owns the statically created page tables (particularly
                        the master page table) and regions, and is also used to
                        allocate new page tables from the page table region.
  \item \verb+vm+       - vm runs various checks on virtual memory access,
                        copies data between user land and kernel space and
                        allocates memory for processes.
  \item mmu HAL -       is the abract MMU interface provided by \verb+mmu.h+
                        and \verb+mmu.c+.
  \item CPU specific MMU code is the module responsible of configuring the
        physical MMU layer and implementing the interface prodived by
        \verb+mmu.c+
\end{itemize}
