\part{Memory Management}

\chapter{Subsystem Overview}

This chapter briefly introduces the architectural layout of memory management
in Zeke at very generic level. Specifically we do not cover memory map layout or
anything hardware specific things here.

Zeke as well as most of major operating systems does its memory management and
mapping in multiple stages. In the kernel stages are built into following layers
of abstraction \ac{MMU} abstraction, \verb+dynmem+ handling dynamic allocation
of contiguous blocks of memory and \verb+kmalloc+ that allocates memory for the
kernel itself. These are the most important parts of the memory management in
Zeke as other parts of the kernel are only utilizing these to allocate or map
memory for use anywhere in the system.

Figure \ref{figure:mm_layers} shows the memory management stack from
top to bottom.

\begin{description}
\item[kmalloc] is a malloc-like interface for allocating arbitrary sized blocks
  of memory.
\item[dynmem] is a block allocator that always allocates memory in block size of
  $1 \:\textrm{MB}$. See fig. \ref{figure:dynmem_blocks}.
\end{description}

Lets assume that some part of the kernel needs a new chunk of memory for some
temporal use, there is no more space left at any of the higher levels and most
importantly the code uses \verb+kmalloc+ to allocate the block. What happens
next is that memory allocation request is eventually passed to dynmem memory
allocator.

dynmem tries to locate the first free memory region in the dynmem memory section
that satisfies the condition
$\textrm{requested size} \le n \times 1 \:\textrm{MB}$. If dynmem finds a free
region it is then reserved and returned to \verb+kmalloc+. \verb+kmalloc+ will
then allocate memory from that and possibly other closely located reservations
for the original caller by using its own algorithm, which is at the moment quite
naive first fit algorithm.

kmalloc stores its linked list of reserved and free blocks in the same memory
that is used to allocate memory for its clients. Listing \ref{list:mblockt}
showsthe \verb+mblock_t+ structure definition used internally in kmalloc for
linking blocks of memory.
