\part{Introduction}

Zeke is a portable operating system for ARM processors.\footnote{Zeke is
portable to at least in a sense of portability between different ARM cores
and architectures.} Figure \ref{figure:zeke} illustrates architectural layers
of the operating system. Scope of Zeke project is to implement a portable
Unix-like\footnote{The project is aiming to implement the core set of kernel
features specified in \ac{POSIX} standard.} operating system from
scratch\footnote{At least almost from scratch, some functionality is derived
from BSD kernels as well as some libraries are taken from other sources.} that
is optimized for ARM architectures and is free of legacy.

In addition to portability another goal has been configurability and adjustable
footprint of the kernel binary as well as the whole OS image. This is achieved
by modular kernel architecture and static compile time configuration. Like for
example \ac{HAL} selection is already almost fully locked at compilation time.
