\part{Introduction}

Zeke is a portable operating system for ARM processors.\footnote{Zeke is
portable to at least in a sense of portability between different ARM cores
and architectures.} Figure \ref{figure:zeke} illustrates architectural layers
of Zeke. Scope of Zeke project is to implement a portable
Unix-like\footnote{Project is aiming to implement the core set of kernel
features specified in \ac{POSIX} standard.} operating system from
scratch\footnote{At least almost from scratch, some functionality is derived
from freeBSD as well as some libraries are taken from other sources.} that
is optimized for ARM architectures and is free of legacy.

In addition to portability another goal has been configurability and adjustable
footprint of the kernel binary. This is achieved by modular kernel architecture
and static compile time configuration. Like for example \ac{HAL} is already
almost fully locked in compilation phase.
