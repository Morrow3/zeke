\chapter{Pseudo Terminals}

A pseudo terminal is a interprocess communication channel that acts like
a terminal and looks like terminal. One end of the channel is the master
end and one end is the slave side of the channel. Pseudo terminals can
be used to implement terminal emulation functionality that looks like an
ordinary user terminal over tty.
