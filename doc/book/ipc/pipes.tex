\chapter{Pipes}

Zeke supports unidirectional \ac{POSIX} pipe \ac{ipc}. The implementation
inherits nofs and it utilizes \verb+queue_r+ to provide lockess data transfer
between a producer and a consumer. However, the current implementation
doesn't guarantee the atomicity the requirement set by \ac{POSIX}. POSIX
requires a transaction under \verb+PIPE_BUF+ bytes to be atomic.
