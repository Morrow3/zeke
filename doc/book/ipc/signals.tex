\chapter{Signals}

The signal system is implemented to somewhat comfort with \acs{POSIX} threads
and process signaling. This means that signals can be sent to both processes as
well as threads. Signals are passed to signal receiving entities in forwarding
fashion, a bit like how packet forwarding could work.

\section{Userspace signal handlers}

Figure \ref{figure:sigstack} shows how entry to a user space signal handler
constructs necessary data on top of the user stack and alters the thread
stack frame.

Figure \ref{figure:syscallint} shows the signal handling flow when
a signal is received in a middle of a system call and the system call
is interrupted to immediately run the user space signal hanlder.
