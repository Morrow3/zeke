\part{Executable File Formats}

The kernel has a support for implementing loader functions for any new
executable format but currently only 32bit \acf{elf} support exist. The image
loading after exec syscall is called happens in \verb+load_image()+ function in
\verb+kern/exec.c+ file. New loader functions can be advertised with
\verb+EXEC_LOADFN+ macro.

\chapter{ELF32}

The \acs{elf} loader in Zeke can be used to load statically linked executables
as well as anything linked dynamically. Currently only two loadable sections can
be loaded, code region and heap region.
