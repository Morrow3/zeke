Documentation
=============

Currently there is some random docs under this directory and a "book" about Zeke
written in LaTeX. This directory will also contain the documentation generated
with Doxygen and that will be under html directory.

Most importantly there is a coding_standards.markdown that you should read. That
document is not only about coding standards but it also tells about kernel
initialization and some other useful stuff.
