Zeke libc
=========

Zeke libc is a partially BSD compatible C standard library tailored for Zeke.

Header files for Zeke libc are located under ../../include in this source tree.

Status
------

Currently there is not much files under this directory and no makefiles and
everything is mostly useless here but some day there will be a full-blown
libc.

At the moment we are compiling and linking c files in this directory directly
with the kernel for testing purposes and everything in sub dirs is ignored
for now.
